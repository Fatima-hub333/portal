In other words, it's important to reach your audience with the proper amount of frequency. The effective frequency is the number of times a person must be exposed to an advertising message before they respond to it. It's easier to rweeach effective frequency faster when you use multiple channels rather than a single channel.

Focus on the Message, not the channel:
Marketers traditionally thaught of display ads (like the ads you see on websites) and videos as two different types of ad formats serving different purposes. 

Video was considered to be more of a branding instrument whereas display ads were used more often to drive purchase. Now, however, you can use display ads and videos in exciing new ways.

Display ads have become as dynamic as videos, and videos now have the interactive capabilities that banners already had.You can use search-engine marketing, traditionally associated with driving purchase, to promote awareness and consideration. Though some channels perform better than others, most are effective for each step of the customer journey. What's key is to reach your audience at the right moment with the right message. Depending on the the creative content of your ads and the format you use, most channels can be used for several stages of the customer journey. The list below shows some example formats and messages.
